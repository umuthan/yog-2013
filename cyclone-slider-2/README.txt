1. Function do_shortcode can be used inside template files. Example: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[cycloneslider id="my-slider"]'); ?>`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my slider not working? =
Check for javascript errors in your page. This is the most common cause of the slider not running.
`cycle not a function` error - most probably you have double jquery (jquery.js) included from improperly coded plugins. Remove the duplicate jquery or deactivate the plugin causing the double jquery include.

Also check if you are using cycle1 by viewing your page source. cycle2 wont work if both are present.

= Why is there is an extra slide that I didn't add? = 
Most probably its wordpress adding paragpraphs on line breaks next to the slides therefore adding a blank `<p>` slide. You can try adding this to functions.php:
`remove_filter('the_content', 'wpautop');`

= How to display it in post/page? =
Use the shortcode `[cycloneslider id="my-slider"]`. Change my-slider to the ID of your slider.

= How to display it inside template files (header.php, index.php, page.php, etc.)? =
As of 2.6.3 - Use `<?php if( function_exists('cyclone_slider') ) cyclone_slider('my-slider'); ?>`. Change "my-slider" to the ID of your slider.

= What are the shortcode options? =
`[cycloneslider id="my-slider" fx="fade" timeout="5000" speed="1000" width="500" height="300" show_prev_next="true" show_nav="true"]`

= How can I use templates? =
`[cycloneslider id="my-slider" template="custom-name"]` 

= Where do I add my own templates? =
Inside your current active theme create a folder named "cycloneslider". Add your templates inside.
